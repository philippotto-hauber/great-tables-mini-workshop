A Short Workshop on Great Tables
================================

This workshop is all about using [Great Tables](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/articles/intro.html) to make beautiful tables for publication and display purposes. We believe that effective tables have these things in common:

1. structuring that aids in the reading of the table
2. well-formatted values, fitting expectations for the field of study 
3. styling that reduces time to insight and improves aesthetics

These materials are for you if:

- you have some experience with data analysis in Python
- you often create reporting that involves summarizations of data
- you were often frustrated with making tables for display purposes outside of Python
- you found beautiful-looking tables in the wild and wondered: 'How could I do that?'
